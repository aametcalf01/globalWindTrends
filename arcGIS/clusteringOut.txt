Running script OptimizedOutlierAnalysis...
************************** Initial Data Assessment ***************************
Making sure there are enough weighted features for analysis....
- There are 4749 valid input features.
Evaluating the Analysis Field values....
- SLOPEINT Properties:
        Min:       -1.0000
        Max:        1.0000
        Mean:      -0.0526
        Std. Dev.:  0.7616
Looking for locational outliers....
- There were 71 outlier locations; these will not be used to compute the optimal fixed distance band.
***************************** Scale of Analysis ******************************
Looking for an optimal scale of analysis by assessing the intensity of clustering at increasing distances....
- The optimal fixed distance band is based on peak clustering found at 1040134.7788 Meters
- Features with no neighbors at this distance were adapted to include their nearest neighbor
************************* Optimized Outlier Analysis *************************
Creating the random reference distribution with 499 permutations....
Finding statistically significant outliers of high and low SLOPEINT values....
- There are 1953 output features statistically significant based on an FDR correction for multiple testing and spatial dependence.
- There are 504 statistically significant high outlier features.
- There are 187 statistically significant low outlier features.
- There are 507 features part of statistically significant low clusters.
- There are 755 features part of statistically significant high clusters
- 5% of features had less than 8 neighbors based on the distance band of 1040134.7788 Meters
*********************************** Output ***********************************
- Pink output features are part of a cluster of high SLOPEINT values.
- Light Blue output features are part of a cluster of low SLOPEINT values.
- Red output features represent high outliers within a cluster of low SLOPEINT values..
- Blue output features represent low outliers within a cluster of high SLOPEINT values.

***************************** Hot Spot Analysis ******************************
Finding statistically significant clusters of high and low SLOPEINT values....
- There are 2002 output features statistically significant based on an FDR correction for multiple testing and spatial dependence.
- 4.7% of features had less than 8 neighbors based on the distance band of 1040134.7788 Meters
*********************************** Output ***********************************
Creating output feature class: C:\Users\andymetcalf\Documents\research\globalWindTrends\arcGIS\stations90\stations90.gdb\stationPoints90_OptimizedHot
- Red output features represent hot spots where high SLOPEINT values cluster.
- Blue output features represent cold spots where low SLOPEINT values cluster.
